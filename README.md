# Hi im Martin Holstad

I'm a front-end developer with two years of hands-on experience building responsive, user-friendly web applications using React, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. Iâ€™m passionate about clean code, intuitive design, and continuous learning. 

I graduated from Noroff School of Technology and Digital Media, specializing in front-end development. I love building interactive, real-world applications that solve problems and enhance everyday experiences.
